Leaving out important details can be problematic legally. Write legibly and clearly. Illegible or ambiguous notes open the door for misinterpretation. Use standard medical terminology and accepted abbreviations. If using an EMR, avoid copy/paste errors. Record in real-time. Chart contemporaneously while details are fresh in your mind rather than waiting until the end of your shift. Late entries raise suspicions. Date, time and sign every entry. This establishes a clear timeline of events. Sign with your full name and credentials.Explain your medical decision making. Articulate your thought process and rationale for diagnosis and treatment decisions. This demonstrates you met the standard of care. Avoid speculation or subjective comments. Stick to objective facts and medical information. Editorializing can be used against you. Make addendums if needed. If you later remember an important detail, it's okay to go back and add it with the current date/time. Never alter original notes. Ensure informed consent is documented. Record that risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed and the patient agreed to the plan. Keep personal notes separate.< > ```{note_check}'''"
