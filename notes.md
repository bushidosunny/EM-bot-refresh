# Welcome to EMMA: Your AI Assistant for Emergency Medicine

Dear Compadre,

Welcome to being the first users for EMMA, my new AI assistant app for emergency medicine. Your participation is invaluable, and I'm grateful for your involvement in this innovative journey.

## The Mission

This is a big maybe, and it may sound cheesy, but EMMA aims to revolutionize emergency medicine by providing instant, actionable insights to doctors worldwide. We're creating an AI co-pilot that augments human expertise, saves lives, reduces suffering, and optimizes medical resources. Our goal is to empower both doctors and patients, transforming healthcare through AI-assisted decision-making, documentation, and patient education.

## Getting Started

1. Visit [emmahealth.ai](https://emmahealth.ai) to register your account
2. Log in to explore EMMA's features

## Key Features

### 1. Mobile to Desktop Sync
Capture vital information on your phone during patient interviews without typing, then continue your work on the desktop.

### 2. Powerful AI Capabilities
EMMA is a robust tool designed to assist you. Experiment with its features and side buttons to discover its full potential, including:

- **Clinical Notes Generation:** Create strongly reasoned medical notes with a single click
- **Comprehensive Differential Diagnosis:** Consider a wide range of possible diagnoses then rank them by probability
- **Follow-up Recommendations:** Receive suggestions for appropriate tests and interventions

### 3. Dynamic Updates and Continuous Learning
EMMA adapts to new information and your input:

- **Real-time Updates:** Add new information (e.g., CT scan results) as it becomes available to update the working DDX
- **Feedback Integration:** If you disagree with a diagnosis or suggestion, tell EMMA and it will adjust
- **Iterative Process:** Keep inputting and refining until you're satisfied with the results

### 4. Your Feedback Matters
Share your thoughts:

- Use the feedback button (bottom-left button in the sidebar)
- Via email, text, pigeon carrier...

Your input is crucial for EMMA's continuous improvement.

## User Tips

1. **Provide Information in Chunks:** Due to the back-and-forth nature of AI on servers, it's more efficient to provide information in chunks rather than piece by piece (like single lab values), unless that's all you need.

2. **Button Descriptors:** Most buttons have descriptors that appear when you hover your mouse over them. Take advantage of these for quick guidance.

## Important Reminder

**EMMA is an adjunct to your clinical judgment, not a replacement. Always rely on your professional expertise.**

Thank you for being part of this. I look forward to hearing about your experiences with EMMA. Encouragement is appreciated but brutal honesty is most valued.

Best regards,

Sunny
